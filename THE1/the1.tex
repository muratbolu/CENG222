\subsection*{a)} 

The expected value $E(X)$ for random variables with finitely many outcomes is
equal to $\displaystyle\sum_{x}^{}xP(x)$.
Therefore, assuming all dice are fair, i.e. all sides have the same probability
of occurring,

\begin{gather*}
    E(\text{Blue die}) = 1 \cdot \tfrac{1}{6}
                       + 2 \cdot \tfrac{1}{6}
                       + 3 \cdot \tfrac{1}{6}
                       + 4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{6}
                       + 5 \cdot \tfrac{1}{6}
                       + 6 \cdot \tfrac{1}{6} = 3.5 \\
    \\
    E(\text{Yellow die}) = 1 \cdot \tfrac{1}{8}
                         + 1 \cdot \tfrac{1}{8}
                         + 1 \cdot \tfrac{1}{8}
                         + 3 \cdot \tfrac{1}{8}
                         + 3 \cdot \tfrac{1}{8}
                         + 3 \cdot \tfrac{1}{8}
                         + 4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{8}
                         + 8 \cdot \tfrac{1}{8} = 3 \\
    \\
    E(\text{Red die}) = 2 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10}
                      + 2 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10}
                      + 2 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10}
                      + 2 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10}
                      + 2 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10}
                      + 3 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10}
                      + 3 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10}
                      + 4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10}
                      + 4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10}
                      + 6 \cdot \tfrac{1}{10} = 3
\end{gather*}

\subsection*{b)} 

I would roll the blue die thrice. By using the linearity of expectation,

\begin{align*}
    \shortintertext{
        \[ E(\text{3 Blue dice}) [0.5ex]= 3 \cdot E(\text{Blue die}) = 10.5 \]
    } 
    E(\text{One of each dice}) &= E(\text{Blue die})
                                + E(\text{Yellow die})
                                + E(\text{Red die}) \\
                               &= 3.5 + 3 + 3 \\
                               &= 9.5
    \shortintertext{\[\]}
    \shortintertext{\[ 10.5 > 9.5 \]}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{c)} 

If the value of the yellow die is 8, then it is no longer a random variable.
Its expected value is trivially 8.
I would choose rolling one of each die this time, since,

\begin{align*}
    E(\text{One of each dice}) &= E(\text{Blue die})
                                + E(\text{Yellow die})
                                + E(\text{Red die}) \\
                               &= 3.5 + 8 + 3 \\
                               &= 14.5
    \shortintertext{\[\]}
    \shortintertext{\[ 14.5 > 9.5 \]}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{d)} 

By using Bayes theorem and the law of total probability,

\begin{align*}
    P(\text{Die is red} \mid \text{Value is 3})
        &= \frac{P(\text{Value is 3} \mid \text{Die is red})
                    \cdot P(\text{Die is red})}
                {P(\text{Value is 3})} \\[1.5ex]
        &= \frac{P(\text{V}_3 \mid \text{D}_\text{r})
                    \cdot P(\text{D}_\text{r})}
                {P(\text{V}_3 \mid \text{D}_\text{b})
                    \cdot P(\text{D}_\text{b}) +
                 P(\text{V}_3 \mid \text{D}_\text{y})
                    \cdot P(\text{D}_\text{y}) +
                 P(\text{V}_3 \mid \text{D}_\text{r})
                    \cdot P(\text{D}_\text{r})} \\[1.5ex]
        &= \frac{\tfrac{2}{10} \cdot \tfrac{1}{3}}
                {\tfrac{1}{6} \cdot \tfrac{1}{3}
                + \tfrac{3}{8} \cdot \tfrac{1}{3}
                + \tfrac{2}{10} \cdot \tfrac{1}{3}} \\[1.5ex]
        &= \frac{\tfrac{2}{10}}
                {\tfrac{1}{6} + \tfrac{3}{8} + \tfrac{2}{10}} \\[1.5ex]
        &= \frac{\tfrac{1}{5}}
                {\tfrac{1}{6} + \tfrac{3}{8} + \tfrac{1}{5}} \\[1.5ex]
        &= \frac{24}{20 + 45 + 24} \\[1.5ex]
        &= \frac{24}{89}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{e)} 

The total value can be 5 in four different ways, namely $(1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2),
(4, 1)$, where the first element represent the value of the blue die and the
second element represent the value of the yellow die.
Since these are independent events, simple multiplication is sufficient.

\begin{align*}
    P(\text{Blue die is 1}) \cdot P(\text{Yellow die is 4})
        &= \tfrac{1}{6} \cdot \tfrac{1}{8} = \tfrac{1}{48} \\[0.5ex]
    P(\text{Blue die is 2}) \cdot P(\text{Yellow die is 3})
        &= \tfrac{1}{6} \cdot \tfrac{3}{8} = \tfrac{3}{48} \\[0.5ex]
    P(\text{Blue die is 3}) \cdot P(\text{Yellow die is 2})
        &= \tfrac{1}{6} \cdot \tfrac{0}{8} = 0 \\[0.5ex]
    P(\text{Blue die is 4}) \cdot P(\text{Yellow die is 1})
        &= \tfrac{1}{6} \cdot \tfrac{3}{8} = \tfrac{3}{48} \\[0.5ex]
    \frac{1}{48} + \frac{3}{48} + 0 + \frac{3}{48} = \frac{7}{48}
\end{align*}

\section*{Answer 2}

\subsection*{a)} 

The event of a specific distributor offering a discount that day can be thought
of being a Bernouilli trial, and the probability of a specific amount of
distributors offering a discount that day can be calculated using Binomial
distribution.
Since Company A has a large amount of distributors and a small chance of
offering a discount, we can use Poisson approximation of Binomial distribution
to calculate the probability of at least four distributors offering a discount
tomorrow.
\newline
The number of distributors are $n = 80$, chance of offering a discount is
$p = 0.025$, and the expected value of discounts per day are $n \cdot p = 2$.
The probability of at least four distributors offering a discount tomorrow is
$F_Y(4) = 0.9473$, where $F_Y$ is the cumulative distribution function of
Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 2$.

\subsection*{b)} 

Assuming the customer is only going to buy a phone when there is a discount
in $A$ or $B$, one can calculate the probability of buying a phone by subtracting the probability of no discounts happening in two days from 1.
\newline
There will be no discounts if both $A$ and $B$ have no discounts.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ will have no discounts with the probability $P(0) = 0.0183$, where $P$ is the probability density function of Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 4$, since we are looking at a two day timespan.
    \item $B$ will have no discounts with the probability $0.9 \cdot 0.9 = 0.81$.
    \item They will both have no discounts with the probability $0.0183 \cdot 0.81 = 0.0148$.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, the customer will be able to buy the phone in two days with the probability $1 - 0.0148 = 0.9852$.
